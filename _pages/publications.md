Welcome to my website. I am an Urban Development Specialist at the World Bank. Prior to my career at the World Bank, I worked as Senior Research Analyst at AidData, a development research lab at the College of William & Mary. I received a Ph.D. in Political Science from Cornell University in 2015. My research focuses on the political economy of development. In particular, I am interested in distributive politics, public finance, development finance, urban development, democratic reforms, and political origins of economic policy.
